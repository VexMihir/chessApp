## 📝 Project Task Requirements

#### 🎯Minimal Requirements:
1. ✅ Allows people to play Chess games over the internet.
	-   ✅ Stable connection.
	-   ✅ Real-Time
2. ✅ Room System.
	-   ✅ Users will be able to select a game room to play another player in. The only input really required from the user is some temporary username.
3. ✅ Be able to represent a chess game on a UI using React and CSS.
#### 🎯 Standard Requirements:
   - ✅ Users should be able to offer a draw or resign (forfeit) the game
-   ✅ Having the last 10 games on the website posted somewhere, where users can click and playback the game.
-   ✅ Handle network issues like disconnects and reconnects.
-   ✅ Be able to see the legal moves of a piece in the UI.
-   ✅ Allows users to retrieve and play back their previous games, step by step.
#### 🎯 Stretch Requirements:
-   ✅ Use some Chess Engine package to evaluate the game at each step during playback.
-   ❌ Computer-controlled chess bot players can play against.
-   ❌ Login system for users.
-   ❌ ELO Rating System.

## ✨ Above and Beyond

## 🔮 Future of Castle & Conquer
- Add a login system that allows users to save their games in our chess database. This also allows for a username-based invite system and a friend system. A barebones login system was in the works by Jason Lai, but was scrapped due to logistical reasons.
- Extend our existing Stockfish AI framework (being used for game analysis) to enable players to play against an AI-controlled bot with varying difficulties.
- Develop and deploy a persistent leaderboard or player rating system, built upon the login system.
- Other QOL changes, like allowing players to change the theme of the board.
